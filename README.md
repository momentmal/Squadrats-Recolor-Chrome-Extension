This was a quick weekend hack using a lot of AI assisted coded - use on your own risk.
Not intented to harm anyone, just a quick workaround to add custom coloring to the Squadrats Chrome Extension since this is something I found lacking.

## Installation - How I set it up

- First copied the original Squadrats.com Extension Files into a custom folder and removed the fingerprint in the manifest.json, deactivated the original extension, and imported the unpacked version, so the Extension does not self update and sits in a know location (the normal installed version can change its path by itself)
- Do this via Chrome in Developer Mode - Manage Extensions - Import Unpacked
- ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4462b532-613a-423b-af3e-df74564a2b59)
- Then I imported my unpacked extension

## Usage

- Should be self-explaining.
- Note, that you need to refresh the page each time you want to see the color changes.
